1. Executive Summary  
This document defines the end -to-end design and delivery plan for an internal IT / 
Support Ticketing System for a single organization with multiple operational teams 
(e.g., IT, Facilities, HR, Security, Applications). The system supports multi -channel 
intake (starting with portal and email), structured triage and routing, SLA tracking, 
auditable workflows, and reporting. The architecture is designed to scale in ticket 
volume and team count without major rewrites.  
2. Objectives and Success Metrics  
2.1 Objectives  
Provide a single place for employees to request help and track progress.  
Ensure tickets route to the correct team quickly and consistently.  
Meet SLA targets for first response and resolution with automatic escalation.  
Improve operational visibility via dashboards, backlog aging, and trend reporting.  
Enable reliable notifications and a complete audit trail for accountability.  
2.2 Success Metrics (examples)  
Median time -to-triage < 15 minutes during business hours.  
P1 first response SLA compliance >= 95%.  
Reduction in duplicate requests (deflection + clear comms) by 10 –20% within 90 
days.  
p95 ticket list load time <= 400 ms under normal load.  
Notification delivery (event to send) <= 60 seconds for 99% of events.  
3. Scope  
3.1 In Scope (Phase 1)  
Requester portal: create ticket, view status, add replies, attachments.  
Email intake: create or append to tickets from inbound emails.  
Agent console: triage, assign, collaborate (internal notes), resolve/close.  
Team-based routing and assignment (rules + optional round -robin).  
SLA: first response + resolution timers with pause rules.  
--- page 3 ---
Notifications: email + (optional) Teams/Slack in later phase.  
Reporting: team backlog, SLA compliance, basic agent/team metrics.  
Audit trail: immutable ticket events and access logs.  
3.2 Out of Scope (initially)  
Full CMDB / asset management (can integrate later).  
Advanced omnichannel (voice, SMS) beyond portal/email (future).  
Customer -facing external tenant model (multi -tenant SaaS).  
Complex ITIL change/problem modules (future).  
4. Stakeholders and Roles  
4.1 Primary Roles  
Requesters (Employees): submit requests and communicate updates.  
Agents: triage and work tickets; may belong to multiple teams.  
Team Leads / Managers: manage queues, escalations, reporting.  
Admins: configure routing rules, SLAs, teams, permissions, integrations.  
System Owners: product owner and technical owner responsible for outcomes.

5. Assumptions and Constraints  
--- page 4 ---
Single organization deployment; teams are internal organizational units.  
Phase 1 channels: Web Portal + Email.  
Identity via existing SSO (e.g., Azure AD / OIDC).  
Attachments stored in object storage with malware scanning.  
Business hours and holidays may differ per team (Facilities vs IT vs Security).  
Data retention and audit requirements will be defined during discovery.  
6. Functional Requirements  
6.1 Ticket Lifecycle and Statuses  
Recommended statuses (configurable):  
New (untriaged)  
Triaged (categorized and owned by a team)  
Assigned (optional explicit state)  
In Progress  
Waiting on Requester  
Waiting on Vendor  
Resolved  
Closed  
Reopened  
6.2 Ticket Fields (minimum)  
Subject, description, category/subcategory  
Priority (P1 –P4) and optional severity  
Assigned team, assignee, watchers/followers  
Channel (portal/email), requester department/location  
Tags and custom fields (phase 2 if needed)  
6.3 Intake Channels  
6.3.1 Web Portal  
--- page 5 ---
Create ticket with validation and category guidance.  
View ticket list and details; add replies; upload attachments.  
Requester sees only their tickets unless explicitly shared.  
6.3.2 Email  
Inbound email creates a ticket or appends to an existing ticket (tokenized reply -to). 
Support for attachments and email threading.  
Auto-reopen logic when requester replies to a resolved ticket (configurable).  
6.4 Routing and Assignment  
Rule-based team routing (category, keyword, department, location, VIP).  
Assignment strategies per team: queue -only, round -robin, skill -based, on -call.  
Transfer ticket to another team with audit event and notifications.  
Share ticket with another team for collaboration without transferring ownership 
(optional).  
6.5 Collaboration  
Public replies visible to requester; internal notes visible to agents only.  
@mentions notify users and add them as watchers.  
Parent/child ticket linking (optional in phase 2).  
6.6 SLA and Escalation  
First response SLA and resolution SLA tracked per ticket.  
Pause SLA when status is Waiting on Requester/Vendor (configurable).  
SLA breach triggers: notify team lead, page on -call, or elevate priority (automation).  
6.7 Notifications  
Email notifications for requester and assignee/team on key events.  
Digest options (daily backlog) for team leads (phase 2).  
Optional Teams/Slack integration (phase 2).  
6.8 Attachments  
--- page 6 ---
Secure uploads, virus scanning, and permission -checked downloads.  
Audit downloads (who/when) for sensitive attachments (optional).  
6.9 Reporting  
Team backlog (open by priority, aging buckets).  
SLA compliance (first response + resolution).  
Volume trends by category and channel.  
Agent workload distribution.  
6.10 Administration  
Manage teams, membership, schedules, and on -call policies.  
Configure categories, routing rules, SLAs, notification templates.  
Role management (agent/lead/admin) and team scoping.  
7. Non-functional Requirements  
7.1 Performance  
Ticket list endpoints: p95 <= 400 ms with pagination and indexed filters.  
Ticket detail: p95 <= 300 ms excluding large attachments.  
Email ingestion to ticket update: <= 2 minutes for 99% of messages.  
7.2 Availability and Reliability  
No lost notifications: use transactional outbox + retries + dead -letter queue.  
Background workers are horizontally scalable.  
Graceful degradation: if search index is delayed, system still functions via DB reads.  
7.3 Security  
SSO (OIDC/SAML), MFA enforced by IdP.  
RBAC and team -scoped access checks on every request.  
Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (DB + object storage).  
Secrets managed via vault/managed secrets service.  
Full audit log for ticket changes and admin configuration changes.  
--- page 7 ---
7.4 Compliance / Data Governance  
PII minimization: limit free -form sensitive fields; apply redaction guidelines.  
Retention policy for tickets, messages, attachments, and audit logs.  
Export capability for legal/HR holds (future).  
7.5 Observability  
Centralized logs, metrics, and tracing (OpenTelemetry).  
Dashboards: API latency, error rate, queue lag, outbox backlog, SLA worker lag.  
Alerting on failed email ingestion, rising DLQ, SLA breach processing delay.  
8. Architecture  
8.1 High-Level Components  
Clients  
  - Requester Portal (Web)  
  - Agent Console (Web)  
  - Email (Inbound/Outbound)  
 
API Layer  
  - API Gateway / BFF (auth, rate limits, validation)  
 
Core Application (Modular Monolith in Phase 1)  
  - Ticket Module (tickets, workflow, assignment)  
  - Messaging Module (public replies, internal notes, mentions)  
  - Routing Module (rules, scoring, assignment strategies)  
  - SLA Module (timers, breach actions)  
  - Notification Module (email templates, send pipeline)  
  - Admin Module (teams, roles, config)  
 
Async Backbone  
  - Queue / Event Bus (jobs: notifications, SLA checks, indexing)  
  - Outbox Publisher (reliable event publish)  
 
Data Stores  
  - Primary DB (Postgres recommended)  
  - Cache (Redis)  
--- page 8 ---
  - Object Storage (attachments)  
  - Optional Search (OpenSearch/Elastic in Phase 2/3)  
8.2 Reliability Pattern: Transactional Outbox  
All state-changing operations write (1) the business data and (2) an outbox row in a 
single DB transaction. A publisher process reads outbox rows and publishes events 
to the queue. This ensures notifications, SLA updates, and indexing are not lost if 
the app crashes between DB commit and event publish.  
8.3 Deployment Topology (reference)  
App service (API + UI) behind load balancer.  
Worker service(s) for queue consumption (scale out horizontally).  
Managed Postgres, Redis, and object storage.  
Email provider (inbound webhook + outbound SMTP/API).  
9. Data Model (Logical)  
9.1 Core Entities  
Ticket: authoritative record of status, priority, assigned team/assignee.  
TicketMessage: conversation entries (public/internal).  
TicketEvent: immutable audit/event stream for every important change.  
Team and TeamMember: membership, roles, scheduling metadata.  
SLA Policy + SLA Instance: per -ticket timers and next_due_at scheduling.  
Outbox: reliable event publishing.  
9.2 Indexing Guidelines (examples)  
tickets(status, assigned_team_id, updated_at DESC)  
tickets(assignee_id, status, updated_at DESC)  
tickets(requester_id, created_at DESC)  
ticket_messages(ticket_id, created_at ASC)  
sla_instances(next_due_at)  
10. API Specification (High -Level)  
--- page 9 ---
10.1 Requester APIs  
POST /tickets (idempotent)  
GET /tickets?mine=true&status= (paginated)  
GET /tickets/{id}  
POST /tickets/{id}/messages (public reply)  
POST /tickets/{id}/attachments  
10.2 Agent APIs  
GET /tickets?team_id=&assignee_id=&status=&priority=&q=  
PATCH /tickets/{id} (safe fields only; use transitions for status)  
POST /tickets/{id}/transition (explicit workflow action)  
POST /tickets/{id}/notes (internal note)  
POST /tickets/{id}/transfer (change owning team)  
POST /tickets/{id}/share (collaboration share)  
10.3 Admin APIs  
POST /teams, PATCH /teams/{id}  
POST /routing -rules, PATCH /routing -rules/{id}  
POST /sla -policies, PATCH /sla -policies/{id}  
POST /roles, PATCH /roles/{id}  
GET /reports/*  
11. Key Workflows (End -to-End)  
11.1 Create Ticket via Portal  
1) Requester submits POST /tickets (idempotency -key)  
2) Ticket Service creates Ticket + TicketEvent + Outbox in one transaction  
3) Outbox Publisher emits TICKET_CREATED  
4) Routing worker assigns team/assignee and emits TICKET_ROUTED / 
TICKET_ASSIGNED  
5) Notification worker sends emails  
--- page 10 ---
6) SLA worker initializes SLA instance and schedules next_due_at  
7) UI shows ticket number and status  
11.2 Reply via Email  
1) Email provider posts inbound webhook  
2) Inbound handler validates org mailbox, parses ticket token  
3) Append TicketMessage (public) + TicketEvent + Outbox  
4) Notifications to assignee/watchers  
5) SLA updates: first response timer stops when agent responds; resolution 
pauses/unpauses by status  
11.3 SLA Breach  
1) SLA worker queries sla_instances where next_due_at <= now()  
2) Marks breach flags, writes TicketEvent SLA_BREACHED  
3) Enqueues escalation actions (notify lead, page on -call, bump priority)  
4) Records action results for auditability  
11.4 Transfer or Share Between Teams  
Transfer:  
  - Owning team changes; assignment may reset; SLA policy may change.  
Share:  
  - Adds collaborating team; does not change owning team; permission is read or 
write.  
Both operations emit events and notify affected teams.  
12. UX Outline

My Work view: assigned tickets, due soon, SLA at risk.  
Ticket detail: internal + public tabs, actions panel, assignment controls.  
--- page 11 ---
Bulk actions: assign, set priority, add tag (optional).  
12.3 Admin Console  
Team management, routing rules editor, SLA policy editor.  
Notification templates and channel configuration.  
Audit log viewer for admin changes.  
13. Implementation Plan and Timeline  
Reference timeline assumes 12 weeks total with 2 -week sprints. Adjust based on 
team size and parallelization.

required.  
P2: High impact to a department or critical workflow; timely response.  
P3: Standard request or incident with workaround available.  
P4: Low priority / informational / cosmetic.  
--- page 15 ---
18.2 Glossary (example)  
SLA: Service Level Agreement; time -based targets for response/resolution.  
Outbox: DB table for reliable event publishing after transactions commit.  
DLQ: Dead -letter queue for messages that repeatedly fail processing.
